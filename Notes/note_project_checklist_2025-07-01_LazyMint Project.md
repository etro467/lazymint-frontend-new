**Date:** July 1, 2025

This checklist outlines the completed and remaining tasks to ensure the LazyMint project is fully functional with an attractive and compelling user experience.

### ✅ **Completed Tasks (Frontend & Initial Setup):**

*   **Frontend Code Acquisition:** Cloned the `lazymint-frontend-app` repository locally.
*   **RevenueCat Removal:**
    *   Removed `@revenuecat/purchases-js` dependency from `package.json`.
    *   Removed `src/config/revenuecat.ts` file.
*   **Bolt Branding Removal:** Removed the "Built on Bolt" badge from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.
*   **Stripe Integration (Frontend):**
    *   Added `@stripe/stripe-js` dependency to `package.json`.
    *   Created `src/config/stripe.ts` for Stripe client-side operations.
    *   Updated `.env.example` to include `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and removed `VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY`.
    *   Refactored `src/stores/subscriptionStore.ts` to use Stripe for subscription management.
    *   Updated `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx` to integrate with Stripe for purchases.
    *   Confirmed `src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx` automatically adapts to new feature gating logic.
*   **Campaign Creation Bug Fix:** Corrected the `createCampaign` function in `src/stores/campaignStore.ts` to properly fetch newly created campaigns.
*   **UI Aesthetic Refinements:**
    *   Applied minimalistic design principles to `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` (typography, spacing, buttons, image).
    *   Applied minimalistic design principles to `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx` (headings, cards, FAQ, CTA).
    *   Updated global color palette in `src/index.css` for a softer, more neutral aesthetic.
*   **Git Management:**
    *   Created and switched to `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix` branch.
    *   Committed all frontend changes to the new branch.
    *   Pushed the `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix` branch to GitHub.

### ⏳ **Remaining Tasks (Backend & Full Functionality):**

*   **Backend Stripe Integration:**
    *   Implement and deploy Firebase Cloud Functions for Stripe:
        *   `createStripeCheckoutSession` (to create checkout sessions).
        *   `handleStripeWebhook` (to process Stripe events and update user subscriptions in Firestore).
        *   `getStripeProducts` (to fetch product/price information from Stripe for the frontend).
*   **Comprehensive Local Testing:**
    *   **User Authentication:** Verify login, registration, and user profile management.
    *   **Campaign Management:** Test creating, updating, deleting, pausing, and archiving campaigns.
    *   **Stripe Subscription Flow:** Test the entire subscription process from the pricing page through Stripe checkout and confirmation of tier update.
    *   **AI-Powered Features:** Verify functionality of AI content generation, QR code generation, and background design (requires backend functions).
    *   **Algorand Integration:** Test `logCampaignToAlgorand` functionality.
    *   **Email Export:** Test `exportEmails` functionality.
    *   **Legal Pages:** Verify dynamic loading of legal content.
*   **Netlify Deployment Configuration:**
    *   Configure Netlify to deploy from the `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix` branch.
    *   Set this branch as the primary deployed version on Netlify.
    *   Add necessary environment variables to Netlify for Stripe and Firebase.
*   **Ongoing UI/UX Review:** Continuously review and refine the UI/UX based on user feedback and further testing to ensure it remains attractive and compelling.

This checklist will serve as our roadmap for completing the LazyMint project. We've laid a strong foundation, and the next focus is on the backend integration and thorough testing.
