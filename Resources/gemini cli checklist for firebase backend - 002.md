 make a checklist in markdown format based on the complete lazymint project backend firebase specs in the files
  contained in this subdirectory folder for our SPRINT, and state what has been accomplished, what is still in
  progress, what has not been accomplished, and what will not or cannot be accomplished.

✦ Here's a checklist summarizing the progress on the LazyMint Firebase backend sprint:

  LazyMint Firebase Backend Sprint Progress Checklist


  This checklist is based on the firebase_studio_backend_prompt.md and LazyMint_PRD_v2.0.md documents.

  ---

  1. Firebase Project Setup

   * [x] Initialize a new Firebase project.
   * [x] Enable Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Functions, and Firebase Storage.

  ---

  2. Firestore Schema (Modular & Concise)


   * [x] users/{userId} collection (fields: email, subscriptionTier, revenueCatCustomerId, campaignCount,
     totalClaimsMade, aiQrGenerationsThisMonth, aiBackgroundGenerationsThisMonth, lastBillingCycleReset,
     createdAt, updatedAt)
   * [x] campaigns/{campaignId} collection (fields: creatorId, title, description, message, logoStoragePath,
     ticketBackgroundMode, customTicketBackgroundStoragePath, aiTicketBackgroundPrompt, qrCodeOverlayPosition,
     claimLimit, currentClaims, expirationDate, status, qrCodeStoragePath, algorandTransactionId, createdAt,
     updatedAt)
   * [x] claims/{claimId} collection (fields: campaignId, fanEmail, editionNumber, ticketHash, maxDownloads,
     ticketExpirationTime, claimedAt, verified, assetDelivered, downloadCount, verificationToken, createdAt,
     updatedAt)
   * [x] algologs/{algologId} collection (fields: campaignId, metadataHash, algorandTransactionId, createdAt,
     updatedAt)
   * [ ] legalContent/{docId} collection (fields: type, title, content, version, lastUpdated, createdAt,
     updatedAt) - Not yet implemented in code, only schema defined.

  ---

  3. Firestore Security Rules


   * [x] users: Authenticated users can read their own document; update subscriptionTier and revenueCatCustomerId
     via Cloud Function.
   * [x] campaigns: Authenticated users can create; creators can read, update, delete their own; public read
     access for specific fields.
   * [x] claims: Creators can read their own campaign claims; unauthenticated users can create via Cloud Function;
     no direct update/delete.
   * [x] algologs: Only Cloud Functions can write; public read access.
   * [x] legalContent: Public read access; only Cloud Functions can write.

  ---

  4. Firebase Storage Rules


   * [x] qrcodes bucket: Only Cloud Functions can write; publicly readable.
   * [x] logos bucket: Authenticated users (creators) can upload; publicly readable.
   * [x] ticket_backgrounds bucket: Only Cloud Functions can write (AI-generated); creators can upload their own;
     publicly readable.
   * [x] campaign_assets bucket: Authenticated users can write; read access via signed URLs (implemented in
     processClaim).

  ---

  5. Firebase Cloud Functions (API Endpoints)


   * [x] createCampaign (in campaigns.ts)
   * [x] processClaim (in claims.ts)
   * [ ] verifyClaim - Not yet implemented.
   * [ ] downloadAsset - Not yet implemented. (Requires image processing library like sharp)
   * [x] handleMonetization (in monetization.ts) - Placeholder for RevenueCat integration.
   * [x] generateArtisticQr (in qrcodes.ts) - Placeholder for GenAI integration.
   * [x] logCampaignToAlgorand (in algorand.ts) - Placeholder for Nodely API integration.
   * [x] getCampaignAnalytics (in analytics.ts)
   * [ ] generateCampaignContent - Not yet implemented.
   * [ ] generateTicketBackground - Not yet implemented.
   * [ ] getLegalContent - Not yet implemented.

  ---

  6. General Implementation Notes for Cloud Functions


   * [ ] Data Consistency (Firestore Transactions): Not explicitly implemented for all multi-document operations.
   * [ ] Secure Secrets (Firebase Secret Manager): Not yet implemented. API keys are not currently used in the
     placeholder functions.
   * [x] Standardized Error Handling: Implemented using functions.https.HttpsError.
   * [ ] Rate Limiting: Not yet implemented.

  ---


  7. Email Sending Strategy

   * [ ] Encapsulated email sending logic (e.g., for verification links) - TODO in `processClaim`.

  ---

  8. Frontend Integration with Firebase SDK


   * [N/A] Authentication, Direct Firestore Reads, Real-time Data / Firestore Listeners, Frontend-Specific Data
     Needs. (These are frontend responsibilities, not part of the backend sprint implementation.)

  ---

  9. Deployment


   * [x] Firebase project configured for deployment via standard Firebase CLI commands.
   * [ ] Cloud Functions deployed to a region close to the expected user base. (Deployment not yet performed.)

  ---

  Summary of Progress:


   * Accomplished: Firebase project setup, Firestore schema definition, Firestore and Storage security rules, and
     the core API functions (createCampaign, uploadAsset, processClaim, handleMonetization, generateArtisticQr,
     logCampaignToAlgorand, getCampaignAnalytics) have been implemented or scaffolded with validation and basic
     logic. Functions have been refactored into separate modules.
   * In Progress: The handleMonetization, generateArtisticQr, and logCampaignToAlgorand functions are implemented
     with placeholders for external API integrations (RevenueCat, GenAI, Nodely).
   * Not Accomplished:
       * Firestore schema for legalContent is defined but not yet reflected in code.
       * Cloud Functions: verifyClaim, downloadAsset, generateCampaignContent, generateTicketBackground,
         getLegalContent are not yet implemented.
       * General Cloud Function best practices: Atomicity (Firestore Transactions), Secure Secrets (Firebase
         Secret Manager), and Rate Limiting are not yet implemented.
       * Email sending logic is a TODO in processClaim.
   * Cannot Be Accomplished (by me directly):
       * Actual integration with external APIs (RevenueCat, GenAI, Nodely) without API keys or specific
         instructions.
       * Image processing with sharp (requires installation and specific implementation details).
       * Deployment to a specific region (requires user execution of firebase deploy).


  The backend is in a good state for the hackathon, with core functionalities in place and clear paths for
  further integration and refinement.
