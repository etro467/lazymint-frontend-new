 ok secrets manager api is enabled... is there a way i can cap rates so i dont get surprised by a big bill?

✦ Yes, absolutely! It's crucial to manage costs, especially with AI services and Cloud Functions, to avoid
  unexpected bills. Google Cloud provides several mechanisms to help you cap rates and stay within budget.

  Here's how you can do it:

  1. Google Cloud Budget Alerts (Essential for Notifications)


  This is your first line of defense. You can set up alerts that notify you when your spending approaches a
  certain threshold.


   * How to set it up:
       1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/ (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
       2. Select your lazymint-hackathon project.
       3. In the left-hand navigation menu, go to "Billing" (you might need to search for it or find it under "IAM
          & Admin" or "Cost Management").
       4. Click on "Budgets & alerts".
       5. Click "CREATE BUDGET".
       6. Follow the prompts to define your budget amount (e.g., $10, $50, $100) and set up alert thresholds (e.g.,
          notify at 50%, 90%, 100% of budget). You can choose to receive email notifications.

   * Benefit: This won't stop spending, but it will give you timely warnings so you can take action (like pausing
     functions or adjusting quotas) before you incur a large bill.

  2. Google Cloud Quotas (Hard Caps on Usage)


  Quotas define the maximum amount of a shared Google Cloud resource that your project can consume. You can view
  and, in some cases, edit these quotas. This acts as a hard cap.


   * How to manage quotas:
       1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/ (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
       2. Select your lazymint-hackathon project.
       3. In the left-hand navigation menu, go to "IAM & Admin" and then "Quotas".
       4. You can filter by service (e.g., "Cloud Functions API", "Vertex AI API") and metric.
       5. For services like Vertex AI, you'll see quotas for things like "Generations per minute" or "Images
          generated per month".
       6. You can request to decrease these quotas if you want a very strict hard cap on usage. Be careful not to
          set them too low that it impacts legitimate usage.

   * Benefit: This provides a hard limit. If you hit a quota, your requests will be rejected, preventing further
     charges for that specific resource.


  3. In-Code Rate Limiting (Application-Level Control)

  We've already implemented this for your AI functions (generateArtisticQr and generateTicketBackground).


   * How it works: Your code checks the user's subscription tier and their monthly generation count stored in
     Firestore. If they exceed their allocated limit, the function throws an error and prevents further AI calls.
   * Benefit: This gives you granular control over usage based on your application's logic and user plans. It's a
     soft cap that you define and manage.

  4. Monitoring and Logging


   * Cloud Monitoring: Use Cloud Monitoring to observe your Cloud Functions invocations, execution times, and
     resource consumption. This helps you identify unexpected spikes in usage.
       * Go to Google Cloud Console -> "Monitoring" -> "Metrics Explorer".
   * Cloud Logging: Review Cloud Functions logs for errors or excessive invocations.
       * Go to Google Cloud Console -> "Logging" -> "Logs Explorer".

  5. Firebase Blaze Plan


  Just a reminder that to use Cloud Functions and most of the Google Cloud services we're integrating (like
  Vertex AI), your Firebase project needs to be on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan. While this means you're
  paying, it also gives you access to these cost management tools.


  By combining these strategies – especially Budget Alerts for notifications and Quotas for hard limits on
  critical services like Vertex AI – you can effectively cap your rates and avoid bill surprises.
