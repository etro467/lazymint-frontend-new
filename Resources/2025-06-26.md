### **State of Mind**

A pivotal day. The initial feeling of being overwhelmed and behind schedule has been replaced by a sharp sense of clarity and strategic focus. The decision to rebuild the entire application from scratch, with a "backend-first" philosophy, feels like a reboot. It's a bold move, but the correct one. The path forward is no longer about patching together disparate parts, but about executing a clean, unified vision. The anxiety is gone; in its place is a focused determination to build a winning product.

### **Highlights & Wins**

1.  **Strategic Pivot:** The decision to start fresh is a massive win. It frees us from previous constraints and aligns perfectly with the "single-prompt build" hackathon category, which is a primary target.
2.  **Backend-First Approach:** We've committed to building the complete Firebase backend *before* prompting the frontend build. This will result in a robust, well-defined API contract and a much cleaner final product.
3.  **Algorand Integration Confirmed:** We've officially decided to incorporate the Algorand logging feature to compete for the Blockchain Challenge prize. This is a high-impact feature with minimal frontend complexity, making it a perfect strategic addition.
4.  **API Access Unblocked:** We confirmed that Nodely provides free, public API endpoints for Algorand. The "expired coupon" is a non-issue, removing a potential blocker and simplifying our integration path.

### **Challenges & Lessons**

The primary challenge is now pure execution speed. We have a clear plan but only three days to implement a full backend. The key lesson learned from reviewing all the project documents is that a well-defined, modular architecture is the foundation for rapid development. We will not compromise on this.

### **Goals & Intentions: The 3-Day Backend Sprint**

This is our new, official plan. The goal is to build a complete, robust, and scalable backend on Firebase. This backend will then serve as the "brain" for the beautiful frontend UI that Bolt.new will generate from a single, comprehensive prompt.

**Day 1 (Tonight/Tomorrow Morning): Firebase Foundation**
*   [x] Set up a new, clean Firebase project.
*   [x] Define and implement the Firestore schema (`users`, `campaigns`, `claims`, `algologs`).
*   [x] Write and deploy strict Firestore Security Rules to protect the data from the start.

**Day 2 (Tomorrow): Core API Layer (Firebase Cloud Functions)**
*   [ ] Implement `createCampaign`: The core function to create new drops.
*   [ ] Implement `uploadAsset`: To handle secure file uploads to Firebase Storage.
*   [ ] Implement `processClaim`: The entire fan email-verification and asset-delivery flow.
*   [ ] Implement `handleStripeWebhook`: To manage user subscriptions.

**Day 3 (Saturday): Advanced Features & Finalization**
*   [ ] Implement `generateArtisticQr`: The Genkit/Gemini integration for creating AI-powered QR codes. This will include caching results to Firestore and a non-AI fallback.
*   [ ] Implement `logCampaignToAlgorand`: The function to post campaign metadata to the Algorand testnet via the Nodely API.
*   [ ] Implement `getCampaignAnalytics`: The function to power the creator dashboard.
*   [ ] Finalize the complete API contract and prepare the "one-shot" prompt for Bolt.new.

**Contingency:**
*   A small budget ($20-50) is allocated for Gemini AI credits to ensure uninterrupted service during the judging period.

This is the path to victory. It's ambitious, but it's clear, focused, and achievable.
