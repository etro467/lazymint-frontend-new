## Firebase Studio Frontend Plan & Requirements Update

**Date:** July 1, 2025

**Context:** New understanding regarding Firebase Studio's capabilities for frontend generation.

**Key Updates:**
*   Firebase Studio is expected to build the frontend, designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing Firebase backend.
*   A new, leaner prompt will be crafted for Firebase Studio, distinct from the previous hackathon-focused prompt.
*   The new prompt will exclude requirements related to hackathon categories that are no longer relevant.
*   **Financial Optimization:** RevenueCat will be replaced with Stripe for payment processing, aiming for a lower transaction fee percentage.

**Implication:** This shift streamlines the frontend development process and optimizes cost efficiency for payment handling.
