âœ¦ Here's a progress report on our LazyMint hackathon project, focusing on the Firebase backend:

  LazyMint Firebase Backend Progress Report


  Overall Mission: To build a robust, scalable Firebase backend for LazyMint, powering a Bolt.new generated
  frontend, and targeting key hackathon prizes (Make More Money, Blockchain, One-Shot, Inspirational Story).

  ---

  I. Accomplished (Backend Core & Structure)


   * Firebase Project Setup:
       * New Firebase project initialized (lazymint-hackathon).
       * Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions, and Storage services enabled.
   * Firestore Schema:
       * All core collections (users, campaigns, claims, algologs) are defined and their structures are reflected
         in the Cloud Functions code.
       * legalContent schema is defined, and modular Markdown files have been created for content.
   * Security Rules:
       * Comprehensive Firestore and Storage security rules are implemented to control data access and file
         uploads.
   * Cloud Functions (API Endpoints):
       * All required Cloud Functions (createCampaign, uploadAsset, processClaim, verifyClaim, downloadAsset,
         handleMonetization, generateArtisticQr, logCampaignToAlgorand, getCampaignAnalytics,
         generateCampaignContent, generateTicketBackground, getLegalContent) have been implemented or scaffolded.
       * Functions are modularized into separate TypeScript files for better organization and maintainability.
   * Key Integrations & Best Practices (Implemented/Structured):
       * `sharp` Image Processing: Integrated into downloadAsset for ticket composition (QR, background, logo,
         text overlays).
       * Firestore Transactions: Implemented in processClaim to ensure atomicity for critical operations.
       * Rate Limiting: Basic, subscription-tier-based rate limiting implemented for AI functions
         (generateArtisticQr).
       * Email Sending: Placeholder for Firebase "Trigger Email" Extension integrated into processClaim.
       * Nodely (Algorand): logCampaignToAlgorand function structured to use Nodely's public Algorand APIs (no API
         key required).
       * Vertex AI (GenAI): Placeholders in generateArtisticQr, generateCampaignContent, and
         generateTicketBackground are updated with PredictionServiceClient calls, ready for actual Vertex AI model
         integration.
   * Git & GitHub:
       * Local Git repository is set up and linked to a GitHub remote.
       * All backend code changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub.


   * Firebase Project Setup:
       * New Firebase project initialized (lazymint-hackathon).

  II. In Progress / Requires Your Action (Critical Next Steps)


   * Firestore `legalContent` Data Population:
       * Action Required: You need to run the upload_legal_content.py script (after installing Python dependencies
         and placing your serviceAccountKey.json) to push the Markdown content into your Firestore legalContent
         collection.
   * Firebase Secret Manager Setup:
       * Action Required: You need to complete the gcloud secrets create commands for REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_SECRET
         and GENAI_API_KEY (if applicable).
       * Action Required: You must grant your Cloud Functions service account the "Secret Manager Secret Accessor"
         role in the Google Cloud Console.
   * External API Integration (Full Implementation):
       * RevenueCat: While handleMonetization is an onRequest webhook, you'll need to configure the actual webhook
         in your RevenueCat dashboard and ensure the secret is correctly verified.
       * Vertex AI: You'll need to ensure the specific Vertex AI models (imagen-text-to-image, text-bison or
         gemini-pro) are enabled in your Google Cloud project and that your service account has the necessary
         permissions to invoke them.
       * Nodely: While no API key is needed, you'll eventually need to integrate the algosdk library and implement
         the actual Algorand transaction logic (signing and sending).
   * `sharp` Text Overlay Refinement:
       * The downloadAsset function has basic text overlay, but fine-tuning positioning, fonts, and styling for a
         polished "symbolic ticket" will require further iteration.
   * Firebase Extensions:
       * Action Required: You need to install and configure the "Trigger Email" Firebase Extension in your project
         to enable email sending from processClaim.

  III. Remaining Major Tasks (Post-Integration)


   * Comprehensive Testing:
       * Unit tests for individual functions.
       * Integration tests for end-to-end flows.
       * Manual testing of all API endpoints via a tool like Postman or a simple frontend.
   * Deployment:
       * Deploying all Cloud Functions to your Firebase project.
   * Frontend Development (Bolt.new):
       * This is the next significant phase, leveraging the completed backend API contract.

  Current Status: We have a robust, well-structured, and largely implemented Firebase backend. The remaining
  work primarily involves integrating with external services and setting up the necessary Firebase
  infrastructure (secrets, extensions) that require your direct action. We are in a strong position to complete
  the backend and move towards the frontend and hackathon submission.
