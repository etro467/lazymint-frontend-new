## Project Progress Update: LazyMint Frontend Refinement

**Date:** July 1, 2025

**Current Objective:** Replace the existing Bolt-generated frontend with a new, robust solution, and deploy it to Netlify. Focus on a minimalistic, uncluttered, clear, and friendly UX.

### **Completed Tasks:**

*   **Frontend Code Acquisition:** Cloned the `lazymint-frontend-app` repository locally.
*   **RevenueCat Removal:**
    *   Removed `@revenuecat/purchases-js` dependency from `package.json`.
    *   Removed `src/config/revenuecat.ts` file.
*   **Bolt Branding Removal:** Removed the "Built on Bolt" badge from `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx`.
*   **Stripe Integration (Frontend):**
    *   Added `@stripe/stripe-js` dependency to `package.json`.
    *   Created `src/config/stripe.ts` for Stripe client-side operations.
    *   Updated `.env.example` to include `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and removed `VITE_REVENUECAT_API_KEY`.
    *   Refactored `src/stores/subscriptionStore.ts` to use Stripe instead of RevenueCat.
    *   Updated `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx` to integrate with Stripe for purchases.
    *   Confirmed `src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx` automatically adapts to new feature gating logic.
*   **Campaign Creation Bug Fix:** Corrected the `createCampaign` function in `src/stores/campaignStore.ts` to properly fetch newly created campaigns.
*   **UI Aesthetic Refinements:**
    *   Adjusted typography, spacing, and image styling in `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` for a minimalistic look.
    *   Refined pricing cards, FAQ, and CTA sections in `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx` for clarity and minimalism.
    *   Updated global color palette in `src/index.css` for a softer, more neutral base.
*   **Git Management:**
    *   Created and switched to `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix` branch.
    *   Committed all changes to the new branch.
    *   Pushed the `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix` branch to GitHub.

### **Remaining Tasks:**

*   **Backend Stripe Integration:** Ensure the Firebase backend has the necessary Cloud Functions for Stripe (e.g., `createStripeCheckoutSession`, `handleStripeWebhook`, `getStripeProducts`) and that they are correctly configured and deployed.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test all frontend functionalities locally, including:
    *   User authentication (login, registration).
    *   Campaign creation and management.
    *   Stripe subscription flow (from pricing page to successful checkout).
    *   All AI-powered features (if applicable and backend functions are ready).
    *   Legal pages.
*   **Netlify Deployment Configuration:** Configure Netlify to deploy from the `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix` branch and set it as the primary deployed version.
*   **Ongoing UI/UX Review:** Continuously review and refine the UI/UX based on user feedback and further testing.

### **Next Steps:**

*   **Verify Firebase Backend:** Confirm that the necessary Firebase Cloud Functions for Stripe integration are implemented and deployed. If not, this will be the next major task.
*   **Local Testing:** Guide Michael through comprehensive local testing of the updated frontend.

This is a significant step forward, Michael. We've addressed key issues and refined the aesthetic. The next crucial step is to ensure the backend is fully aligned for Stripe and then to thoroughly test everything.
