## Session Summary: LazyMint Frontend Refinement & Strategy

**Date:** July 1, 2025

**Key Outcomes of this Session:**

*   **Clarified Project Direction:** Confirmed the objective is to refine the existing `lazymint-frontend-app` rather than rebuilding from scratch, focusing on fixing bugs and improving aesthetics.
*   **RevenueCat Replaced with Stripe (Frontend):**
    *   Successfully removed `@revenuecat/purchases-js` dependency from `package.json`.
    *   Deleted the `src/config/revenuecat.ts` file.
    *   Added `@stripe/stripe-js` dependency to `package.json`.
    *   Created `src/config/stripe.ts` for client-side Stripe operations.
    *   Updated `.env.example` to reflect Stripe API key and remove RevenueCat key.
    *   Refactored `src/stores/subscriptionStore.ts` to use Stripe for subscription management.
    *   Updated `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx` to integrate with Stripe for purchase initiation.
*   **Campaign Creation Bug Fixed:** Corrected the logic in `src/stores/campaignStore.ts` for fetching newly created campaigns, addressing a previous bug.
*   **UI/UX Aesthetic Improvements:**
    *   Applied minimalistic design principles to `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` and `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx` (adjusting typography, spacing, button styles, and image presentation).
    *   Refined global color variables in `src/index.css` for a softer, more neutral aesthetic.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Created a new Git branch: `feature/stripe-integration-and-bug-fix`.
    *   Committed all frontend changes (Stripe integration, bug fix, UI refinements) to this new branch.
    *   Successfully pushed the new branch to the GitHub repository (`etro467/lazymint-frontend-app`).

**Next Critical Step:**

*   The immediate priority upon return is to **verify and implement the necessary Firebase Cloud Functions for Stripe integration** (e.g., `createStripeCheckoutSession`, `handleStripeWebhook`, `getStripeProducts`). This is crucial for the Stripe integration to function end-to-end.

**User's Plan:** Michael will log off to rest and will return to continue the project, aiming for swift and forthright completion.

Looking forward to continuing our work, Michael. Get some good rest!
