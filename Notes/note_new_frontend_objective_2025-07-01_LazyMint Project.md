## New Objective: Replace Frontend and Deploy to Netlify

**Date:** July 1, 2025

**Context:** The hackathon is complete. The previous Bolt-generated frontend for LazyMint proved buggy, specifically with starting new campaigns. 

**Goal:** The primary objective is to replace the existing, problematic frontend with a new, robust solution. This new frontend will then be deployed to Netlify.

**Next Steps (to be determined):**
*   Decide on the framework/approach for the new frontend (e.g., fresh React/Vite/TypeScript project, or another framework).
*   Implement the new frontend.
*   Configure deployment to Netlify.
